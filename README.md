## The aplication <br />
An calculator app that do the basics operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. <br />

This project as made with angular, which is a Typescript-based open-source web application development framework. Most used for build an SPA(Single page application).
For this project i was exploring a data binding property. <br />

## Angular two-way data binding & property binding

**Two-way data binding:** Two-way binding is a mechanism where data flows both ways from the component to the view and back. The component and view are always in sync, and changes made on either end are immediately updated both ways. Two-way binding is commonly used when dealing with forms where the user input is used to update the component’s state and vice versa. It is the exact opposite of property binding, where the data goes from the component to the view. An example of this type of data binding can be described using the example below: <br />

`src\app\app.component.html` <br />

`src\app\app.component.ts` <br />

**Property binding:** Property binding is a one-way mechanism that lets you set the property of a view element. It involves updating the value of a property in the component and binding it to an element in the view template. Property binding uses the [] syntax for data binding. <br />

`src\app\app.component.html `<br />

## Neomorphism CSS style <br />
**Neumorphism** (aka neomorphism) is a relatively new design trend and a term that’s gotten a good amount of buzz lately. It’s aesthetic is marked by minimal and real-looking UI that’s sort of a new take on skeuomorphism — hence the name.  <br />

`src\app\app.component.css` <br />
